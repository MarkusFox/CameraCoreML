# CameraCoreML
A simple iOS app that uses CoreML to predict camera input

To launch the app you have to add the Resnet50.mlmodel to the source directory.
The Resnet50 model can be downloaded here: https://coreml.store/resnet50

If you choose to try a different model simply drag and drop your .mlmodel file to the directory and change line 25 in CameraViewController to fit the name of your model.
