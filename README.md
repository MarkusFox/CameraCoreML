# CameraCoreML
A simple Swift iOS app that uses Core ML to predict camera input

To launch the app you have to add a Core ML model (e.g. Resnet50.mlmodel) to the project directory. Simply drag and drop your .mlmodel file to the directory (in Xcode) and change line 24 in CameraViewController to fit the name of your model.

Resnet50 and other machine learning models can be downloaded here: https://coreml.store or https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/build-run-models/
